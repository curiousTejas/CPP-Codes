# C++ Practice Codes
## Introduction
Hey there good people! So in the beginning of December, I decided to challenge myself into coding for 31 Days straight, as a practice to improve my skills and also to revise some basics too. This repo consists of 31 Codes, all in C++, and are organized in different folders according to the day-number. The level of these codes ranges from Basic to Intermediate. I'm still in learning process and I wish to dive deep in the ocean of C++ and explore some more pearls!

## Final Thoughts
This challenge has been such an amazing experience full of exploring new stuff and revising some basics too! Although consistency throughout was a struggle, this challenge did make me learn a lot.
- I gained confidence with Open Source.
- I explored stuff about C++ I never knew about!
- I wrote long codes and short codes as well.
- I revisited some basics to strengthen my fundamentals.
- I became more organized with my daily schedule!
- This seemed as a good practice for 100 Days of Code!

This challenge was not difficult, but for beginners like me, it really is a nice practice for enhancing skills and strengthening fundamentals too!
